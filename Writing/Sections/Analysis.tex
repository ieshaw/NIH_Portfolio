Mean-Variance Portfolio optimization takes the form

\begin{align*}
\min_{X}& \quad X^T \Sigma X \\
\text{subject to}& \quad X^T \mu \geq \mu_0 \\
& \quad X \bullet 1 = 1 \\
& \quad X \geq 0
\end{align*}

With the terms defined as 
\begin{align*}
n &= \text{ number of assets} \\
\Sigma &= \text{ co-variance of assets }, \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n} \\
\mu &= \text{ expected return vector}, \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times 1} \\
\mu_0 &= \text{ expected return of portfolio, to be varied in analysis}, \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times 1} \\
\end{align*}

In 2012 Lo et. al. proposed setting the correlation matrix (necessary for constructing the covariance matrix $\Sigma$) based on expert opinion. Our proposed addition to the body of work is to develop correlation on a min-max regularization of the cosine similarity of citation and mutual citation.
